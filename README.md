## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* There are several things that I was not able to get all the way functioning as they should. Something wasn't working with navigation
* that I couldn't figure out, so I ended up patchworking in a somewhat janky work around solution. I wish I could have tied up all the
* loose ends I still have left, but I've entirely burnt myself out, so I think this is the best it's going to get.
